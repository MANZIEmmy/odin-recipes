    <h3>Steps for making Watermelon Cucumber Salad</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the watermelon into bite-sized pieces.
            This will make it easier to eat and will also help the watermelon absorb the dressing.</li>
        <li>Add the dressing right before serving.This salad is best when the watermelon is fresh and crisp. 
            If you dress it too early, the watermelon will start to get mushy.</li>
        <li>Use a good quality feta cheese.Feta is a key ingredient in this salad, 
            so you'll want to use a good quality cheese. I like to use goat's milk feta for its rich flavor.</li>
        <li>Gently cut the basil right before adding it to the salad.This will help it retain its flavor and color.</li>
    </ol>
