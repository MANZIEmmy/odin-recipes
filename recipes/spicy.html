    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled shrimp cook quickly so there is no need to be away from the party for long. Leave out the cayenne pepper if you'd prefer less heat and this is still a yummy dish. 
        Shrimp can withstand lots of mild and bold flavors so you can create many variations of this dish. Grilling keeps the party safely outside.</p>
